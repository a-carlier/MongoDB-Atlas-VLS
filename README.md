# MongoDB-Atlas-VLS

Projet MongoDB Antoine CARLIER - Pierre-Emmanuel HENRY

Only Lille Data will be used because of its easier format, but most programs will also work with stations from other cities (Only _program_4-5.py_ should not work).

In order to use the database, you ned to create a file "database_info.py" where you put Mongo Atlas Information like this:

### database_info.py 
```
db_name = "<DATABASE_NAME>"
db_user = "<DATABASE_USER>"
db_password = "<DATABASE_PASSWORD>"
```
